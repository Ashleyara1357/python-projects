# 💰 Expense Tracker

## 🚀 Overview
This Python program is a simple but powerful Expense Tracker that allows you to:
- Add expenses with date, category, amount, and description
- View all expenses in a neatly formatted table
- Filter expenses by category or month
- Calculate and display total expenses and summary by category
- Delete specific expenses

It uses Python's `csv` module for storing data and `tabulate` for clean table formatting.
